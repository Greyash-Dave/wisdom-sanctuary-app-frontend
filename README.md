## Overview

Wisdom Sanctuary is a prototype AI-powered platform designed to support youth mental wellness through interactive story-driven guidance. Users connect with AI mentors inspired by historical figures—such as Musashi, Rumi, and Chanakya—who offer support using culturally resonant philosophies and reflective learning.

The experience is stigma-free, privacy-focused, and presented with a calming, sanctuary-themed UI to foster comfort.
